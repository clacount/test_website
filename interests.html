        In addition to day to day work in software engineering, I also enjoy deliving into personal side projects from time to time as well.
        For more details, please check out my personal <a href="https://github.com/clacount"> GitHub page</a>, which contains some independent 
        projects that I've built so far.

        As stated in my Education section, I was a music minor while attending UVM. Music has always been a large part of my life and continues to be to this day.
        At 12 years old, I picked up my first pair of drumsticks, which started a life-long love affair with all things drums and music. To wind
        down from the coding, I like to record and post covers of songs that I enjoy playing along to. To check out my drumming content,
        check out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-sIdwDEsbvpSE-Z__ex7nw"> Youtube channel </a>, which covers a wide genere of musical
        styles.
