                    <p>
                    <em> <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong></em>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Starting in 2015 as a Pharamcy Applications Administrator,
                        Chris began his journey into the Tech industry by handling 
                        application support, involving extensive use of a linux CLI,
                        as well as SSH/SFTP principles with on-prem servers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2018,
                        an opportunity presented itself, where Chris was able to join 
                        Covetrus, where he spearheadded the creation & implementation 
                        of the Electronic Transfer of Controlled Prescription Data to 
                        all 50 states.
                    </p>
                        In 2019, yet another opportunity presented itself
                        at Capital One, where Chris worked as both an Associate Software
                        Engineer and Software Engineer. Focusing primarily on Production
                        Support, Chris was able to oversee the health and well-being of
                        Capital One Trade Credit's entire production stack, as well as
                        assist individual teams by creating new tools and alerts within
                        the production code, utilizing langues such as PSQL, MSQL, MySQL,
                        and Java. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, in 2021, Chris joined VividCloud as a Software Engineer,
                        where, after only 2 weeks from hire, received his Google Cloud
                        Associate Engineer certification. In early 2022, he was promoted
                        to a Senior Software Engineer and has continued to make great
                        strides in creating products for clients utilizing Quarkus Java,
                        Python, C, Vue, and Typescript.
